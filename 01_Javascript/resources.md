>#Why Scope? The Principle of Least Access

>So, what's the point in limiting the visibility of variables and not having everything available everywhere in your code? One advantage is that scope provides some level of security to your code. One common principle of computer security is that users should only have access to the stuff they need at a time.

>Think of computer administrators. As they have a lot of control over the company's systems, it might seem okay to grant full access user account to them. Suppose you have a company with three administrators, all of them having full access to the systems and everything is working smooth. But suddenly something bad happens and one of your system gets infected with a malicious virus. Now you don't know whose mistake that was? You realize that you should them basic user accounts and only grant full access privileges when needed. This will help you track changes and keep an account of who did what. This is called The Principle of Least Access. Seems intuitive? This principle is also applied to programming language designs, where it is called scope in most programming languages including JavaScript which we are going to study next.

>As you continue on in your programming journey, you will realize that scoping parts of your code helps improve efficiency, track bugs and reduce them. Scope also solves the naming problem when you have variables with the same name but in different scopes. Remember not to confuse scope with context. They are both different features.
