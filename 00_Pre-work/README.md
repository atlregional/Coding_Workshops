# Welcome to the pre-work folder!

### Hi! This pre-work will help you build a foundation of HTML & CSS so that when the Javascript workshop comes around you'll be ready to jump in and pull it all [html + css + js] together.

This work should take you 4-5 hours to complete (total guesstimate). 
Here's how to get started;

1. visit https://dash.ga.co
2. set up a free account
3. get to work on completing Project 1, Project 2, and Project 4 (parts 1 & 2)
4.  *__bonus__* feel free to try out Project 3, the remainder of project 4, and Project 5


### If you get stuck feel free to use the projects_resources.md to help find a solution. If you get really stuck, I've included the code solutions in the dash.ga.co_helper.md, so give it a look. 
I find it helpful to compare code using www.text-compare.com. It's incredibly helpful when your eyes begin to glaze over.
